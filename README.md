# Punk Beer Web App

The Punk Beer Web App is a project developed as a task for LimeChain. It showcases a Web2 and Web3 experience allowing users to explore, rate, and manage their favorite beers. The project is divided into two main parts: a Web2 version that handles the traditional web application functionalities, and a Web3 version that integrates blockchain technology for decentralized features. These two versions are maintained on separate branches within the project repository.

#### ! Due to the upcoming shutdown of PunkAPI, we have hosted the API data ourselves.
